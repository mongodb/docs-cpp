Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to run a replace operation on a MongoDB collection.
A replace operation removes *all* fields in the target document and replaces them with new ones.
You can call the ``replace_one()`` method to replace a single document.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``restaurants`` collection in the ``sample_restaurants``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To access this collection
from your C++ application, instantiate a ``mongocxx::client`` that connects to an Atlas cluster
and assign the following values to your ``db`` and ``collection`` variables:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/replace.cpp
    :start-after: start-db-coll
    :end-before: end-db-coll
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:

To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

Replace Operation
-----------------

You can perform a replace operation by calling the ``replace_one()`` method.
This method removes all fields except the ``_id`` field from the first document that
matches the search criteria. It then inserts the fields and values you specify into the document. 

Each replace method requires the following parameters:

- **Query filter** document: Specifies which document to replace. For
  more information about query filters, see the 
  :manual:`Query Filter Documents section </core/document/#query-filter-documents>` in
  the {+mdb-server+} manual.

- **Replace** document: Specifies the fields and values to insert in the new document. 

Replace One Document Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses the ``replace_one()`` method to replace the fields and values
of a document in which the ``name`` field value is ``Bagels N Buns``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/replace.cpp
   :start-after: start-replace-one
   :end-before: end-replace-one
   :language: cpp
   :dedent:


Options 
~~~~~~~

You can modify the behavior of the ``replace_one()`` method by
passing an instance of the ``mongocxx::options::replace`` class as an optional
parameter. The following table describes the public member functions of the 
``mongocxx::options::replace`` class. You can call these public functions on an 
instance of the class using the dot operator ``(.)``. 

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Public Member Function 
     - Description

   * - ``bypass_document_validation(<bool bypass_document_validation>)``
     - | Specifies whether the replace operation bypasses document validation. When set to ``true``,
         this lets you replace a document with a new document that doesn't meet the schema validation requirements. 
         For more information about schema validation, see :manual:`Schema
         Validation </core/schema-validation/#schema-validation>` in the MongoDB
         Server manual.
       | Defaults to ``false``.

   * - ``collation(<document::view_or_value collation>)``
     - | Specifies the kind of language collation to use when sorting
         results. Accepts a :manual:`collation document </reference/collation/#collation-document>` as its argument.
       | For more information, see :manual:`Collation </reference/collation/#std-label-collation>`
         in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

   * - ``comment(<bson_value::view_or_value comment>)``
     - | Specifies a comment to attach to the operation. Accepts a comment of any BSON type as its argument.
       | For more information, see the :manual:`insert command
         fields </reference/command/insert/#command-fields>` guide in the
         {+mdb-server+} manual for more information.

   * - ``hint``
     - | Specifies the index to search for the **Query Filter** document. Accepts an instance of the mongocxx::v_noabi::hint class representing an
         index name.
       | For more information, see the :manual:`hint statement </reference/command/update/#std-label-update-command-hint>`
         in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

   * - ``let``
     - | Specifies a document with a list of values to improve operation readability.
         Values must be constant or closed expressions that don't reference document
         fields. For more information, see the :manual:`let statement
         </reference/command/replace/#std-label-replace-let-syntax>` in the
         {+mdb-server+} manual.

   * - ``upsert``
     - | Specifies whether the replace operation performs an upsert operation if no 
         documents match the query filter. For more information, see the :manual:`upsert
         statement </reference/command/replace/#std-label-replace-command-upsert>`
         in the {+mdb-server+} manual.
       | Defaults to ``false``.

   * - ``write_concern``
     - | Sets the write concern for the operation.
         For more information, see :manual:`Write Concern </reference/write-concern/>`
         in the {+mdb-server+} manual.


The following code uses the ``replace_one()`` method to find a document with a ``name`` value of 
``In-N-Out Burger`` and replace it with a new document describing a restaurant with a ``name`` value of ``7th Street Burger``.
Because the ``upsert`` option is set to ``true`` and the ``sample_restaurants.restaurants`` collection 
does not contain a document with a ``name`` value of ``In-N-Out Burger``,
the {+driver-short+} inserts a new document into the collection rather than replacing an existing document: 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/replace.cpp
   :start-after: start-replace-options-upsert
   :end-before: end-replace-options-upsert
   :language: cpp
   :dedent:


The following code shows how to use the ``hint`` option to optimize the query performance of the ``replace_one()`` method:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/replace.cpp
   :start-after: start-replace-options-hint
   :end-before: end-replace-options-hint
   :language: cpp
   :dedent:

The above example uses :ref:`create_index() <cpp-indexes>` to create an ascending single-field index using the ``name`` field. 
The name of this index, ``name_1``, is then passed as an argument to the ``hint`` member function of ``opts``, an instance of the 
``mongocxx::options::replace`` class. ``opts`` is then passed as the third argument to the ``replace_one()`` function, which replaces
 a document with a ``name`` field value of ``Nobu` with a new document with a ``name`` field value of ``La Bernadin``.

Return Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``replace_one()`` method returns an instance of
the ``mongocxx::result::replace`` class. This class contains the following
member functions:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Function
     - Description

   * - ``matched_count()``
     - | Returns the number of documents that matched the query filter, regardless of
         how many were replaced.

   * - ``modified_count()``
     - | Returns number of documents modified by the replace operation. If a replaced
         document is identical to the original, it is not included in this
         count.
         
   * - ``result()``
     - | Returns the bulk write result for the operation.

   * - ``upserted_id()``
     - | Returns the ID of the document that was upserted in the database, if the driver
         performed an upsert.

Examples 
^^^^^^^^
       
The following example uses the ``replace_one()`` method with an instance of the ``mongocxx::options::replace`` class as an optional
parameter to replace the fields and values
of the first document in which the  ``borough`` field value is ``Brooklyn`` with a different
document for a restaurant with the ``name`` field value ``McDonald's``. It calls the
``modified_count()`` member function to print the number of modified documents 
and the ``matched_documents()`` member function to print the number of matched documents: 

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/write/replace.cpp
      :start-after: start-replace-result
      :end-before: end-replace-result
      :language: cpp
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 

      Modified documents: 1
      Matched documents: 10
