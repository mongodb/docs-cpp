   .. step:: Create a project directory

      From your root directory, run the following command in your shell to create a directory called
      ``cpp-quickstart`` for this project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir cpp-quickstart

      Run the following commands to create a ``quickstart.cpp`` application file in the ``cpp-quickstart``
      directory:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cd cpp-quickstart
         touch quickstart.cpp

   .. step:: Create your {+driver-short+} application

      Copy and paste the following code into the ``quickstart.cpp`` file, which queries
      the ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/get-started/quickstart.cpp

   .. step:: Assign the connection string

      Replace the ``<connection string>`` placeholder with the 
      connection string that you copied from the :ref:`cpp-quick-start-connection-string`
      step of this guide.

   .. step:: Run your C++ application

      In your shell, run the following commands to compile and run this application:
      
      .. code-block:: none

         c++ --std=c++17 quickstart.cpp $(pkg-config --cflags --libs libmongocxx) -o ./app.out
         ./app.out
      
      .. tip::

         MacOS users might see the following error after running the preceding commands:

         .. code-block:: bash
            :copyable: false

            dyld[54430]: Library not loaded: @rpath/libmongocxx._noabi.dylib
 
         To resolve this error, use the ``-Wl,-rpath`` linker option to set the ``@rpath``, as shown
         in the following code: 

         .. code-block:: none

            c++ --std=c++17 quickstart.cpp -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib/ $(pkg-config --cflags --libs libmongocxx) -o ./app.out
            ./app.out

      The command line output contains details about the retrieved movie
      document:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         { "_id" : { "$oid" : "573a1399f29313caabceeb20" },
         "plot" : "Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace
         and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.",
         ...
         "title" : "The Shawshank Redemption", 
         ...

      If you encounter an error or see no output, ensure that you specified the
      proper connection string in the ``quickstart.cpp`` file and that you loaded the
      sample data.

After you complete these steps, you have a working application that
uses the driver to connect to your MongoDB deployment, runs a query on
the sample data, and prints out the result.
