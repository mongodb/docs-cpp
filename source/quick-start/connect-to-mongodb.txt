   .. step:: Create a project directory

      In your shell, run the following command to create a directory called
      ``cpp-quickstart`` for this project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir cpp-quickstart

      Run the following command to navigate into the ``cpp-quickstart`` directory:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cd cpp-quickstart

      Run the following command to create a ``quickstart.cpp`` file to contain your
      application:

      .. code-block:: bash

         touch quickstart.cpp

   .. step:: Create your {+driver-short+} application

      Copy and paste the following code into the ``quickstart.cpp`` file

      .. include:: /includes/quick-start/quickstart.cpp

   .. step:: Assign the connection string

      Replace the ``<connection string>`` placeholder with the 
      connection string that you copied from the :ref:`cpp-quick-start-connection-string`
      step of this guide.

   .. step:: Run your C++ application

      In your shell, run the following commands to compile and run this application:
      
      .. code-block:: none

         c++ --std=c++11 quickstart.cpp $(pkg-config --cflags --libs libmongocxx) -o ./app.out
         ./app.out

      The command line output contains details about the retrieved movie
      document:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         { "_id" : { "$oid" : "573a1398f29313caabce9682" },
         "plot" : "A young man is accidentally sent 30 years into the past in a time-traveling
         DeLorean invented by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown, and must make sure his high-school-age
         parents unite in order to save his own existence.",
         ...
         "title" : "Back to the Future", 
         ...

      If you encounter an error or see no output, ensure that you specified the
      proper connection string in the ``quickstart.cpp`` file and that you loaded the
      sample data.

After you complete these steps, you have a working application that
uses the driver to connect to your MongoDB deployment, runs a query on
the sample data, and prints out the result.
