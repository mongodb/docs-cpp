Overview
--------

On this page, you can see copyable code examples that show common
{+driver-short+} methods for retrieving documents.

.. tip::

   To learn more about any of the methods shown on this page, see the link
   provided in each section.

To use an example from this page, copy the code example into the
:ref:`sample application <cpp-read-sample>` or your own application.
Be sure to replace all placeholders, such as ``<connection string>``, with
the relevant values for your MongoDB deployment.
