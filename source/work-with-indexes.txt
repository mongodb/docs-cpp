Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use **indexes** with the {+driver-short+}.
Indexes can improve the efficiency of queries and add additional functionality
to querying and storing documents.

Without indexes, MongoDB must scan every document in a collection to find the
documents that match each query. If an appropriate index exists for a query, 
MongoDB can use the index to limit the documents it must inspect and 
improve potential query performance. 

Operational Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To improve query performance, build indexes on fields that appear often in
your application's queries and operations that return sorted results. Each
index that you add consumes disk space and memory when active, so we recommend
that you track index memory and disk usage for capacity planning. In addition,
when a write operation updates an indexed field, MongoDB also updates any related
index.

Because MongoDB supports dynamic schemas, applications can query against fields
whose names are not known in advance or are arbitrary. MongoDB 4.2 introduced
:manual:`wildcard indexes </core/index-wildcard/>` to help support these
queries. Wildcard indexes are not designed to replace workload-based index
planning.

For more information about designing your data model and choosing indexes appropriate for your application, see the
:manual:`Data Modeling and Indexes </core/data-model-operations/#indexes>` guide
in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To access this collection
from your C++ application, instantiate a ``mongocxx::client`` that connects to an Atlas cluster
and assign the following values to your ``db`` and ``collection`` variables:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/indexes/indexes.cpp
    :start-after: start-db-coll
    :end-before: end-db-coll
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:

To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

Create an Index
---------------

MongoDB supports several different index types to support querying your data.
The following sections describe the most common index types and provide sample
code for creating each index type:

- :ref:`cpp-single-field-index`
- :ref:`cpp-compound-index`

.. _cpp-single-field-index:

Single-Field Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:manual:`Single-field indexes </core/index-single/>` are indexes with a
reference to a single field within a collection's
documents, improving query and sort performance. Single-field indexes support
:manual:`TTL (time to live) indexes </core/index-ttl>`, which
automatically remove documents from a collection after a certain amount of time
or at a specific clock time.

To create a single-field index, call the ``create_index()`` method and specify: 

- The field on which to create the index
- The sort order for the indexed values (``1`` for ascending or ``-1`` for descending)

.. note::

   The ``_id_`` index is an example of a single-field index. This index is
   automatically created on the ``_id`` field when a new collection is created.

The following example creates an ascending single-field index on the ``title`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/indexes/indexes.cpp
   :start-after: start-index-single
   :end-before: end-index-single
   :language: cpp
   :copyable:

To learn more about single-field indexes, see :manual:`Single Field Indexes
</core/index-single>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

.. _cpp-compound-index:

Compound Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:manual:`Compound indexes </core/index-compound/>` are indexes that hold references to multiple
fields within a collection's documents, improving query and sort performance. 

To create a compound index, call the ``create_index()`` method using the same
syntax that you use to create :ref:`single field indexes <cpp-single-field-index>`.

The following example creates a compound index that sorts the ``title`` field in ascending order and the 
``year`` field in descending order: 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/indexes/indexes.cpp
   :start-after: start-index-compound
   :end-before: end-index-compound
   :language: cpp
   :copyable:

To learn more about compound indexes, see :manual:`Compound Indexes
</core/index-compound>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

.. _cpp-indexes-remove:

Remove an Index
---------------

You can remove any unused index except the default unique index on the
``_id`` field using the following methods: 

- ``drop_one()``, which removes a single specified index from the collection
- ``drop_all()``, which removes *all indexes* from the collection 

Remove a Single Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To remove a single index from a collection, call the ``drop_one()`` method and pass in 
the index name or an instance of the index you want to remove.  

The following example removes an index with the name ``"title_1"`` from the ``movies``
collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/indexes/indexes.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :start-after: start-remove-index
   :end-before: end-remove-index

.. note::

   You cannot remove a single field from a compound text index. You must
   drop the entire index and create a new one to update the indexed
   fields.

Remove All Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting with MongoDB 4.2, you can drop all indexes by calling the
``drop_all()`` method on the index view in your collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/indexes/indexes.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :start-after: start-remove-all-indexes
   :end-before: end-remove-all-indexes

For earlier versions of MongoDB, pass ``"*"`` as a parameter to your call to
``drop_one()`` on the index view in your collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/indexes/indexes.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :start-after: start-remove-all-wildcard
   :end-before: end-remove-all-wildcard
