Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to run a database command with the
{+driver-short+}. You can use database commands to perform a variety of
administrative and diagnostic tasks, such as fetching server statistics,
initializing a replica set, or running an aggregation pipeline.

.. important:: Prefer Driver Methods to Database Commands

   The driver provides wrapper methods for many database commands.
   We recommend using driver methods instead of executing database
   commands when possible.
   
   To perform administrative tasks, use the :mongosh:`MongoDB Shell </>`
   instead of the {+driver-short+}. Calling the ``db.runCommand()``
   method inside the shell is the preferred method to issue database
   commands, as it provides a consistent interface between the shell and
   drivers.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To access this collection
from your C++ application, instantiate a ``mongocxx::client`` that connects to an Atlas cluster
and assign the following values to your ``db`` and ``collection`` variables:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/run-command.cpp
    :start-after: start-db-coll
    :end-before: end-db-coll
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:

To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

Execute a Command
-----------------

To run a database command, call the ``run_command()`` execution method on a ``mongocxx::database`` instance 
and pass in a document specifying the command and any relevant parameters. The document's key is the command to run, 
and the value is typically supplied as ``1``. The value does not affect the command response, which is returned as a 
``bsoncxx::document::value`` type. 

You can use the ``run_command()`` method with any database command. 
For a full list of database commands and corresponding parameters, see :manual:`Database Commands </reference/command/>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual. 

.. The ``run_command()`` method returns the command response as a ``bsoncxx::document::value`` type. 

The following example shows how you can use the ``run_command()``
method to run the ``hello`` command, which returns information about
the current member's role in the replica set, on a database:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/run-command.cpp
      :start-after: start-run-hello
      :end-before: end-run-hello
      :language: cpp
      :dedent:
   
   .. output:: 
      :language: cli
      :visible: false
      
      { "topologyVersion" : ..., "hosts" : [ ... ], "setName" : ..., ..., 
        "lastWrite" : ..., "majorityWriteDate" : ..., "maxBsonObjectSize" : ..., ...,
        "readOnly" : ..., "ok" : ..., "$clusterTime" : ..., "operationTime" : ... }
      { "topologyVersion" : { "processId" : ..., "counter" : ... }, "hosts" : [ ... ], ...,
        "isWritablePrimary" : ..., "secondary" : ..., "primary" : ..., ...,
        "readOnly" : ..., "ok" : ..., "$clusterTime" : ..., "operationTime" : ... } 
        

.. cpp-command-options:

Command Options
---------------

To customize command execution behavior, you can set options in the command 
document that you pass to the ``run_command()`` method. To learn more about 
a command and the options that it accepts, locate the command and follow the 
corresponding link on the :manual:`Database Commands </reference/command/>` page 
in the {+mdb-server+} manual. 

For example, you can instruct the ``connectionStatus`` command 
to return the full set of privileges that currently-authenticated users possess by setting the ``showPrivileges`` 
option to ``true`` in the command document: 

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/run-command.cpp
      :start-after: start-run-connectionStatus
      :end-before: end-run-connectionStatus
      :language: cpp
      :dedent:
   
   .. output:: 
      :language: cli
      :visible: false

 run the ``connectionStatus`` command 
by passing in a boolean value for 
For example, you can set read preference to run the command with 
You can specify optional command behavior for the ``command()``
and ``runCursorCommand()`` methods.

The ``command()`` method accepts a ``RunCommandOptions`` object. To learn
more about the ``RunCommandOptions`` type, see the `API documentation <{+api+}/types/RunCommandOptions.html>`__.

The ``runCursorCommand() method`` accepts a ``RunCursorCommandOptions``
object. To learn more about the ``RunCursorCommandOptions`` type, see
the `API documentation <{+api+}/types/RunCursorCommandOptions.html>`__.

Starting in version 6.0 of the {+driver-short+}, you can pass only the
following options to the ``command()`` method:

- ``comment``
- ``enableUtf8Validation``
- ``raw``
- ``readPreference``
- ``session``

You can set additional options in the document that you pass to
the ``command()`` method. To learn more about a command and the
additional options that it accepts, locate the command and follow the
link on the :manual:`Database Commands </reference/command/>` section of
the Server manual.

The following code shows how to specify a ``grantRolesToUser`` command
that executes with a ``majority`` write concern:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 4

   const commandDoc = {
       grantRolesToUser: "user011",
       roles: [ "readWrite" ],
       writeConcern: { w: "majority" }
   };
   const result = await myDB.command(commandDoc);

.. note:: Read Preference

   The ``command()`` and ``runCursorCommand()`` methods ignore
   the read preference setting you may have set on your ``Db`` object.
   By default, these methods use the ``primary`` read preference.

   The following code shows how to specify a read preference and pass it
   as an option to the ``command()`` method:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript

      const commandOptions = { readPreference: "nearest" };
      const result = await myDB.command(commandDoc, commandOptions);
   
   For more information on read preference options, see :manual:`Read
   Preference </core/read-preference/>` in the Server manual.

Response
--------

Each method returns a ``Document`` object or a cursor that contains
the response from the database after the command has been executed. Each
database command performs a different function, so the response content
can vary across commands. However, every response contains documents
with the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - <command result>
     - Provides fields specific to the database command. For example,
       ``count`` returns the ``n`` field and ``explain`` returns the
       ``queryPlanner`` field.

   * - ``ok``
     - Indicates whether the command has succeeded (``1``)
       or failed (``0``).

   * - ``operationTime``
     - Indicates the logical time of the operation. MongoDB uses the
       logical time to order operations.
       
       .. seealso::
  
          To learn more about logical time, see our :website:`blog post about
          the Global Logical Clock </blog/post/transactions-background-part-4-the-global-logical-clock>`.

   * - ``$clusterTime``
     - Provides a document that returns the signed cluster time. Cluster time is a
       logical time used for ordering of operations.

       The document contains the following fields:

       - ``clusterTime``, which is the timestamp of the highest known cluster time for the member.
       - ``signature``, which is a document that contains the hash of the cluster time and the ID
         of the key used to sign the cluster time.

Example
-------

The following code shows how you can use the ``runCursorCommand()`` method to
run the ``checkMetadataConsistency`` command on the ``testDB`` database
and iterate through the results:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/crud/runCommand.js
   :language: javascript
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-runcommand
   :end-before: end-runcommand

Output
~~~~~~

The output contains the contents of the cursor object. The documents
describe any metadata inconsistencies in the database:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     type: ...,
     description: ...,
     details: {
       namespace: ...,
       info: ...
     }
   }
   {
     type: ...,
     description: ...,
     details: {
       namespace: ...,
       collectionUUID: ...,
       maxKeyObj: ...,
       ...
     }
   }

.. note::

   If you store the command response in a cursor, you see only the
   command result documents when you access the contents of the cursor. You won't
   see the ``ok``, ``operationTime``, and ``$clusterTime`` fields.
