Overview
--------

MongoDB supports multiple mechanisms that you can use to authenticate your application.
This page contains code examples that demonstrate each of these mechanisms.

.. tip::
  
  To learn more about any of the authentication mechanisms on this page, see the
  :ref:`cpp-auth` and :ref:`cpp-enterprise-auth` pages.

To use an authentication example from this page, copy the code example into the
:ref:`sample application <cpp-auth-sample>` or your own application.
Be sure to replace all placeholders in the code examples, such as ``<hostname>``, with
the relevant values for your MongoDB deployment.

SCRAM-SHA-256
-------------

.. literalinclude:: /includes/authentication.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :copyable: true
   :start-after: // start-scram-sha-256
   :end-before: // end-scram-sha-256

To learn more about SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication, see :ref:`cpp-scram-sha-256` in
the Authentication guide.

SCRAM-SHA-1
-----------

.. literalinclude:: /includes/authentication.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :copyable: true
   :start-after: // start-scram-sha-1
   :end-before: // end-scram-sha-1

To learn more about SCRAM-SHA-1 authentication, see :ref:`cpp-scram-sha-1` in
the Authentication guide.

MONGODB X.509
-------------

.. literalinclude:: /includes/authentication.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :copyable: true
   :start-after: // start-x509
   :end-before: // end-x509

To learn more about X.509 authentication, see :ref:`cpp-x509` in
the Authentication guide.

MONGODB-AWS
-----------

The following sections show how to connect to MongoDB by using the MONGODB-AWS
authentication mechanism. When you use the MONGODB-AWS mechanism, the {+driver-short+} attempts to
retrieve your AWS credentials from the following sources, in the order listed:

1. Named parameters passed to the Connection URI
#. Environment variables
#. AWS EKS AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity request
#. ECS container metadata
#. EC2 instance metadata
 
Each section shows how to create the connection URI to authenticate with
MONGODB-AWS when retrieving your AWS credentials from the specified source.

To learn more about authenticating with AWS, see
:ref:`cpp-mongo-aws` in the Authentication guide.

:ref:`cpp-kerberos` in the Enterprise Authentication guide.

PLAIN SASL
----------

.. note:: MongoDB Enterprise Only

   PLAIN SASL authentication is available only in MongoDB Enterprise.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/authentication.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :copyable: true
    :start-after: // start-plain
    :end-before: // end-plain

To learn more about authenticating with PLAIN SASL, see
