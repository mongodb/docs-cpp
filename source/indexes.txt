Overview
--------

On this page, you can see copyable code examples that demonstrate how to use the
{+driver-short+} to work with common types of indexes.

.. tip::

  To learn more about working with indexes, see the :ref:`cpp-work-with-indexes`
  guide. To learn more about any of the indexes shown on this page, see the link
  provided in each section.

To use an example from this page, copy the code example into the
:ref:`sample application <cpp-index-sample>` or your own application.
Be sure to replace all placeholders in the code examples, such as ``<connection string>``, with
the relevant values for your MongoDB deployment.

Single-Field Index
------------------

The following code shows how to create an ascending single-field index:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/index-code-examples.cpp
   :start-after: start-single-field
   :end-before: end-single-field
   :language: cpp
   :copyable:

To learn more about single-field indexes, see the
:ref:`cpp-single-field-index` section of the Work With Indexes guide.

Remove an Index
---------------

The following code shows how to remove an index:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/index-code-examples.cpp
   :start-after: start-remove-index
   :end-before: end-remove-index
   :language: cpp
   :copyable:

To learn more about removing indexes, see the
:ref:`cpp-indexes-remove` section of the Work With Indexes guide.

Remove All Indexes
------------------

The following code shows how to remove all indexes in a collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/index-code-examples.cpp
   :start-after: start-remove-all-indexes
   :end-before: end-remove-all-indexes
   :language: cpp
   :copyable:

:ref:`cpp-indexes-remove` section of the Work With Indexes guide.
