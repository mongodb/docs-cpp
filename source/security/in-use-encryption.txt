Overview
--------

You can use the {+driver-short+} to encrypt specific document fields by using a
set of features called **in-use encryption**. In-use encryption allows
your application to encrypt data *before* sending it to MongoDB
and query documents with encrypted fields.

In-use encryption prevents unauthorized users from viewing plaintext
data as it is sent to MongoDB or while it is in an encrypted database. To
enable in-use encryption in an application and authorize it to decrypt
data, you must create encryption keys that only your application can
access. Only applications that have access to your encryption
keys can access the decrypted, plaintext data. If an attacker gains
access to the database, they can see only the encrypted ciphertext data
because they lack access to the encryption keys.

You can use in-use encryption to encrypt fields in your MongoDB
documents that contain the following types of sensitive data:

- Credit card numbers
- Addresses
- Health information
- Financial information
- Any other sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII)

MongoDB offers the following features to enable in-use encryption:

- :ref:`Queryable Encryption <subsection-qe>`
- :ref:`Client-side Field Level Encryption <subsection-csfle>`

.. _subsection-qe:

Queryable Encryption
--------------------

Queryable Encryption is the next-generation in-use encryption feature,
first introduced as a preview feature in {+mdb-server+} version 6.0 and
as a generally available (GA) feature in MongoDB 7.0. Queryable
Encryption supports searching encrypted fields for equality and encrypts
each value uniquely.

.. important:: Preview Feature Incompatible with MongoDB 7.0
   
   The implementation of Queryable Encryption in MongoDB 6.0 is incompatible with
   the GA version introduced in MongoDB 7.0. The Queryable Encryption preview 
   feature is no longer supported.

To learn more about Queryable Encryption, see :manual:`Queryable
Encryption </core/queryable-encryption/>` in the MongoDB Server manual.

.. _subsection-csfle:

Client-side Field Level Encryption
----------------------------------

Client-side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE) was introduced in MongoDB
Server version 4.2 and supports searching encrypted fields for equality.
CSFLE differs from Queryable Encryption in that you can select either a
deterministic or random encryption algorithm to encrypt fields. You can only
query encrypted fields that use a deterministic encryption algorithm when
using CSFLE. When you use a random encryption algorithm to encrypt
fields in CSFLE, they can be decrypted, but you cannot perform equality
queries on those fields. When you use Queryable Encryption, you cannot
specify the encryption algorithm, but you can query all encrypted
fields.

When you deterministically encrypt a value, the same input value
produces the same output value. While deterministic encryption allows
you to perform queries on those encrypted fields, encrypted data with
low cardinality is susceptible to code breaking by frequency analysis.

.. tip::

   To learn more about these concepts, see the following Wikipedia
   entries:

   - :wikipedia:`Cardinality <w/index.php?title=Cardinality_(data_modeling)&oldid=1182661589>`
   - :wikipedia:`Frequency Analysis <w/index.php?title=Frequency_analysis&oldid=1182536787>`

This section shows how to configure CSFLE by using the following
mechanisms:

- :ref:`Automatic Encryption <cpp-csfle-automatic>`
- :ref:`Explicit Encryption <cpp-csfle-explicit>`

.. _cpp-csfle-automatic:

Configure Automatic Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
   
   Automatic client-side field level encryption requires MongoDB Enterprise
   Server v4.2 or later. The community version of the server supports only
   automatic decryption and explicit client-side field level encryption.

Automatic encryption allows you to perform encrypted read and write operations
without specifying how to encrypt fields. Automatic encryption relies
on the ``mongocryptd`` binary, which is pre-packaged with MongoDB Enterprise
Server. The ``mongocryptd`` binary spawns automatically when the driver
encrypts data.

Alternatively, you can explicitly start the ``mongocryptd`` binary by setting
the ``extra_options`` field of an ``options::auto_encryption`` instance.
Then, pass these options to your client in a ``client_opts`` instance.

The following code shows how to start the ``mongocryptd`` binary separately
from the driver:

.. code-block:: cpp

   auto mongocryptd_options = make_document(kvp("mongocryptdBypassSpawn", true));

   options::auto_encryption auto_encrypt_opts{};
   auto_encrypt_opts.extra_options({mongocryptd_options.view()});

   options::client client_opts;
   client_opts.auto_encryption_opts(std::move(auto_encrypt_opts));

   // Create and use your client here

Set an Encryption Schema
````````````````````````

You can use the ``schema_map`` option to specify an automatic encryption schema.
Encryption schemas contain user-specified rules that identify which
fields must be encrypted and how to encrypt those fields.

Set the ``schema_map`` option to a JSON document that aligns
with the `JSON Schema Draft 4 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04>`__
standard syntax. This document must include the field names to encrypt
and a nested ``encrypt`` object under each field name, which sets the
encryption options to use.

.. tip::

   To learn more about encryption schemas, see
   :manual:`CSFLE Encryption Schemas </core/csfle/reference/encryption-schemas/>`
   in the {+mdb-server+}

The following code shows the syntax for specifying a JSON Schema document:

.. code-block:: cpp

   auto data_key_id = client_encryption.create_data_key("local");
   auto json_schema = document{} << "properties" << open_document << "encryptedFieldName" << open_document << "encrypt"
                                 << open_document << "keyId" << open_array << data_key_id << close_array << "bsonType"
                                 << "string"
                                 << "algorithm"
                                 << "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Deterministic" << close_document << close_document
                                 << close_document << "bsonType"
                                 << "object" << finalize;

To view a full example that uses the preceding ``json_schema`` document to
configure an automatic encryption schema, see the :github:`Automatic CSFLE
</mongo-cxx-driver/blob/master/examples/mongocxx/automatic_client_side_field_level_encryption.cpp>`
example in the driver source code.

.. tip::

   You can also specify an automatic encryption schema for 
   server-side field level encryption. To view a full example,
   see the :github:`Server-Side Field Level Encryption Enforcement </mongo-cxx-driver/blob/master/examples/mongocxx/server_side_field_level_encryption_enforcement.cpp>`
   example in the driver source code.

.. _cpp-csfle-explicit:

Configure Explicit Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Explicit encryption allows you to perform encrypted operations
by using the driver's encryption library. To use explicit encryption,
you must specify the encryption logic throughout your application.

The following example configures explicit encryption
for an insert operation, which inserts an encrypted message
into the database:

.. code-block:: cpp

   // Configure your MongoDB client here

   auto kms_providers = document{} << "local" << open_document << "key"
                                   << local_master_key << close_document
                                   << finalize;

   options::client_encryption client_encryption_opts{};
   client_encryption_opts.key_vault_namespace({"keyvault", "datakeys"});
   client_encryption_opts.kms_providers(kms_providers.view());
   client_encryption_opts.key_vault_client(&client);

   class client_encryption client_encryption(std::move(client_encryption_opts));

   // Explicitly encrypts a BSON value
   auto to_encrypt = bsoncxx::types::bson_value::make_value("secret message");
   auto encrypted_message = client_encryption.encrypt(to_encrypt, encrypt_opts);

   // Explicitly decrypts a BSON value
   auto decrypted_message = client_encryption.decrypt(encrypted_message);

   // Inserts the encrypted value into the database
   coll.insert_one(make_document(kvp("encryptedField", encrypted_message)));

To view a full example that configures explicit encryption,
see the :github:`Explicit Encryption </mongo-cxx-driver/blob/master/examples/mongocxx/explicit_encryption.cpp>`
example in the driver source code.

Explicit Encryption with Automatic Decryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure explicit encryption and automatic decryption,
which is supported for all users. To configure automatic decryption
without automatic encryption, create an ``options::auto_encryption``
instance and set its ``bypass_auto_encryption`` field to ``true``.
Then, apply these options to your client.

The following example creates a ``options::auto_encryption`` instance
to configure explicit encryption with automatic decryption,
then passes this options instance to the ``auto_encryption_opts`` field
of a ``options::client``. This creates a client configured to
use automatic decryption:

.. code-block:: cpp

   options::auto_encryption auto_encrypt_opts{};
   auto_encrypt_opts.bypass_auto_encryption(true);

   options::client client_opts{};
   client_opts.auto_encryption_opts(std::move(auto_encrypt_opts));
   class client client_encrypted {uri{}, std::move(client_opts)};

To view a full example that configures explicit encryption
with automatic decryption, see the :github:`Explicit Encryption Auto Decryption
</mongo-cxx-driver/blob/master/examples/mongocxx/explicit_encryption_auto_decryption.cpp>`
example in the driver source code.
