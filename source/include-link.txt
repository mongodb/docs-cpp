Overview
--------

In this guide you will learn how to use the {+driver-short+} in your own projects. Examples are provided for using the {+driver-short+} with CMake and with ``pkg-config``.

Example Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples on this page use the ``view_and_value.cpp`` example program from the {+driver-short+} source code. Obtain the {+driver-short+} source code by following the :ref:`cpp-quick-start-download-and-install` guide, if you have not previously done so.

You do not need to run this program on a MongoDB server.

Library References
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples use references to components of the {+driver-short+}. For CMake projects, the ``mongo::bsoncxx_shared`` target is used. For pkg-config projects, the ``libbsoncxx`` package is used. You may use the following library targets, depending on the needs of your project:

- CMake
  - ``mongo::bsoncxx_shared``
  - ``mongo::mongoccxx_shared``
  - ``mongo::bsoncxx_static``
  - ``mongo::mongoccxx_static``
- pkg-config
  - ``libbsoncxx``
  - ``libmongocxx``
  - ``libbsoncxx-static``
  - ``libmongocxx-static``

The availability of targets is dependent on the particular installation method.

In the sections that follow, replace ``<path-to-mongo-cxx-driver-sources>`` with the actual path where the {+driver-short+} source tree is located on your system.

CMake
-----

You can use the {+driver-short+} through CMake. CMake provides the ``find_package`` command, which your project can use to locate the {+driver-short+} once it is installed. Alternatively, your project can use the advanced ``add_subdirectory`` command without requiring installation of the {+driver-short+}.

With Driver Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installing the {+driver-short+} enables using it in a simple and straighforward way. After installing, you can use CMake's ``find_package`` command to integrate the {+driver-short+} with your project. To learn how to install the {+driver-short+}, visit the following guides:

- :ref:`cpp-quick-start-download-and-install` to install from source
- :ref:`cpp-installation-advanced` to install from packages

To use the ``find_package`` command, create a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file in your project directory. The following example creates a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file in the ``/home/user/project1`` project directory that uses ``find_package``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/cmake_with_driver_installation.txt
  :caption: /home/user/project1/CMakeLists.txt
  :start-after: -- sphinx-include-start --

Then, you can build and run your project. The execution should produce output resembling the following sample output:

.. code-block:: none

   $ cd /home/user/project1
   $ cmake -Bbuild
   -- The CXX compiler identification is GNU 14.2.0
   -- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info
   -- Detecting CXX compiler ABI info - done
   -- Check for working CXX compiler: /usr/bin/c++ - skipped
   -- Detecting CXX compile features

   -- Performing Test CMAKE_HAVE_LIBC_PTHREAD - Success
   -- Found Threads: TRUE

   -- Generating done (0.0s)
   -- Build files have been written to: /home/user/project1/build
   $ cmake --build build
   [ 50%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/view_and_value.dir/<path-to-mongo-cxx-driver-sources>/examples/bsoncxx/view_and_value.cpp.o
   [100%] Linking CXX executable view_and_value
   [100%] Built target view_and_value
   $ ./build/view_and_value
   { "team" : "platforms", "id" : { "$oid" : "66f4be6fef9eb8b9240619f0" }, "members" : [ "tyler", "jason", "drew", "sam", "ernie", "john", "mark", "crystal" ] }
   Got key, key = team
   Got String!
   Got key, key = id
   Got ObjectId!
   Got key, key = members
   Got Array!
   array element: tyler
   array element: jason
   array element: drew
   array element: sam
   array element: ernie
   array element: john
   array element: mark
   array element: crystal
   as expected, we have a team
   document has 3 keys.
   document keys are:
   team
   id
   members

If you encounter errors, you may need to specify additional options to the initial CMake command. The specific options depend on your particular environment, however there are two options that address most common issues. For instance, if your compiler does not default to at least C++17, use the ``-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17`` CMake option. If you installed the driver to a non-standard location, you may need to specify the ``-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/<path-to-mongo-cxx-driver-installation>`` option. For example:

.. code-block:: none

   $ cmake -Bbuild -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/mongodb/cxx-driver

Without Driver Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternatively, you can use CMake's ``add_subdirectory`` command without installing the {+driver-short+}. This is an advanced technique that, unlike the  ``find_package`` command, does not support specifying version constraints. There are additional drawbacks associated with ``add_subdirectory``, but discussion of those is beyond the scope of this document.

.. note::

   You may need to adjust build flags for your project to
   accommodate this approach. Your project's invocation of CMake must include any flags or
   options that you would have passed to the {+driver-short+} as part of its build.

To use the ``add_subdirectory`` command, create a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file in your project directory. The following example creates a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file in the ``/home/user/project2`` project directory that uses ``add_subdirectory``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/cmake_without_driver_installation.txt
  :caption: /home/user/project2/CMakeLists.txt
  :start-after: -- sphinx-include-start --

.. note::

   Note that in this approach the CMake target is referred to simply
   as ``bsoncxx_shared``, without the ``mongo::`` namespace. The namespace
   is added as part of the CMake module installation, which is not performed
   in this approach.

Then, you can build and run your project. The following shows a truncated example of the CMake output and the program execution output immediately following:

.. code-block:: none

   $ cmake -Bbuild
   $ cmake --build build
   $ ./build/view_and_value 
   { "team" : "platforms", "id" : { "$oid" : "67207dcf532837a4470cc090" }, "members" : [ "tyler", "jason", "drew", "sam", "ernie", "john", "mark", "crystal" ] }
   Got key, key = team
   Got String!
   Got key, key = id
   Got ObjectId!
   Got key, key = members
   Got Array!
   array element: tyler
   array element: jason
   array element: drew
   array element: sam
   array element: ernie
   array element: john
   array element: mark
   array element: crystal
   as expected, we have a team
   document has 3 keys.
   document keys are: 
   team 
   id 
   members

If you encounter errors, then refer to the preceding section, which includes suggested additional CMake options for resolving common build errors.

pkg-config
----------

If your project is not CMake-based, you can use ``pkg-config`` to integrate the {+driver-short+} with your project. Because pkg-config provides less flexibility than CMake, we recommend preferring the CMake-based approach when possible.

You can only use the {+driver-short+} with pkg-config if you fully install the driver.

The following code uses ``pkg-config`` to include and link the {+driver-short+}. Replace the ``/<path-to-mongo-cxx-driver-sources>`` placeholder with the location of the {+driver-short+} source tree is located on your system:

.. code-block:: none

   $ c++ /<path-to-mongo-cxx-driver-sources>/examples/bsoncxx/view_and_value.cpp $(pkg-config --cflags libbsoncxx) -I/<path-to-mongo-cxx-driver-sources> $(pkg-config --libs libbsoncxx) -o view_and_value
   $ ./view_and_value 
   { "team" : "platforms", "id" : { "$oid" : "67207262672b96dc3b0fc150" }, "members" : [ "tyler", "jason", "drew", "sam", "ernie", "john", "mark", "crystal" ] }
   Got key, key = team
   Got String!
   Got key, key = id
   Got ObjectId!
   Got key, key = members
   Got Array!
   array element: tyler
   array element: jason
   array element: drew
   array element: sam
   array element: ernie
   array element: john
   array element: mark
   array element: crystal
   as expected, we have a team
   document has 3 keys.
   document keys are: 
   team 
   id 
   members

You can adapt the preceding command line for more complex projects or specific build systems depending on how they consume pkg-config packages.
