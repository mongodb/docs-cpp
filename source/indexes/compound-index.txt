Overview
--------

Single field indexes are indexes with a reference to a single field of a
document in a collection. They also support :manual:`TTL Indexes </core/index-ttl>`
that automatically remove documents from a collection after a certain
amount of time or at a specified clock time.

To create a compound index, call the ``create_index()`` method and specify: 

- The fields on which to create the index
- The sort order for the indexed values, ``1`` for ascending or ``-1`` for descending.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To access this collection
from your C++ application, instantiate a ``mongocxx::client`` that connects to an Atlas cluster
and assign the following values to your ``db`` and ``collection`` variables:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/indexes/indexes.cpp
    :start-after: start-db-coll
    :end-before: end-db-coll
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:

To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

Create Compound Index
---------------------

The following example creates a compound index that sorts the ``title`` field in ascending order and the 
``year`` field in descending order: 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/indexes/indexes.cpp
   :start-after: start-index-compound
   :end-before: end-index-compound
   :language: cpp
   :copyable:

The following is an example of a query that is covered by the index
created in the preceding code example:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/indexes/indexes.cpp
      :start-after: start-index-single-query
      :end-before: end-index-single-query
      :language: php
      :dedent:
   
   .. output::
      :language: cli
      :visible: false
      
      { "_id" :..., "plot" : "Peter Pan enters the nursery of the Darling children...",
      "genres" : [ "Adventure", "Fantasy", "Family" ], "runtime" : 105,...}
